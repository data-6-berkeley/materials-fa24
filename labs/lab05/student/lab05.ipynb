    "## The [apply](http://data8.org/datascience/_autosummary/datascience.tables.Table.apply.html#datascience.tables.Table.apply) method\n",
    "\n",
    "The `apply` method allows us to map a function's behavior onto an entire column of a table. We can use built-in Python functions (like `max`) or we can define our own functions and then *apply* those functions to the columns of a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `apply` method takes at least 2 arguments. The first is a function, and the rest are as many column labels you need to run that function. The number of columns you need to specify is dependent on the number of arguments the function has. For example, if the function you provide needs two inputs, you need to list two columns for it to work on.\n",
    "\n",
    "`apply` returns a NumPy array of the transformed values. We can ask questions like \"How can I categorize the items in this column?\" (like converting grade percentages into letter grades from lecture). We can also make modifications to a table, like rounding all the values in a column to a certain accuracy.\n",
