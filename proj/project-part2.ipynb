    "1. Use the outputs of the TF-IDF dictionary to describe specific references people are making that are significant (feel free to do additional external research if you'd like). Those of you using the airline tweets dataset, the word counts dictionary may end up being more useful than TF-IDF (so you're welcome to use that instead).\n",
    "2. Generate at least two plots that involve your CSS concept as one variable (e.g. the codes applied from gpt-4o-mini), choosing visualizations that are appropriate for the type of variable you're using.\n",
    "3. Each plot is paired with some sort of analysis (3-4 sentences per visual) explaining the relationship (or lack thereof) that we're observing. It is OK to have visualizations that do not have a clear correlation! That's data for you :)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few ideas:\n",
    "1. All of the datasets also contain other columns that you could explore. For example, is there a relationship between the CSS concepts that you've applied to a particular tweet, and the number of likes it received?\n",
    "2. Is there any difference between the codes applied by hand vs by gpt-4o-mini? Or between gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4o-mini?\n",
    "3. Are there any relationships within certain codes in your codebook? For example, examining if Tweets that were tagged with an anger emotion generally had higher levels of emotional intensity.\n"
