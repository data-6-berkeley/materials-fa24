In fact, a [study](https://homepage.stat.uiowa.edu/~mbognar/1030/Bickel-Berkeley.pdf) found that female applicants disproportionately applied to highly competitive majors with low acceptance rates (e.g., English), while men more often applied to less competitive majors with higher acceptance rates. *More female applicants applying to competitive programs skewed the combined data, creating the appearance of bias against female applicants, when in many cases, women were either equally likely or more likely to be admitted compared to men in the same department.*"
